 * note there are 8 biostacks that define your area of specialization: 
    * genomics
    * Drug development
    * vaccine informatics
    * medicinal chemistry
    * cheminformatics
    * data analytics
    * software development
    * science communication 

+  Individuals should write a script (using any language) that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) and your biostack  
  * Note that we have to have at least 7 different languages. IMPORTANT: Inform the version of the program. Follow below to find yours:
    * [x] Python 
    * [x] Java
    * [x] Ruby
    * [x] C
    * [x] R
    * [x] C++

###### Output Template (Your script output should be something like this)
```
NAME: *Your full name*
E-MAIL: *Your e-mail* 
SLACK USERNAME: @+*username*
BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose. The only first letter is capital* 
TWITTER HANDLE:@*username*
HAMMING DISTANCE: *Hamming distance between SLACK USERNAME and TWITTER HANDLE, output would be obtained as a numeric value*
```
***After you get the desired output, please name your file yourname_stage_0_script.py/R/sh etc;
An example: Premnath_stage0_script.py***
