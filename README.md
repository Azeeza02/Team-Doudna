**HackBio** is a virtually regimented research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping scientists with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills, by the end of the internship, successful interns should have:
+ Honed their skills in a specific bioinformatics method
+ Have at least a peer-reviewed article to show for the internship experience.

## Objective (For team members)
#### Stage 0Ô∏è‚É£
+ Update your slack workspace tag to [0] and put in your biostack
+  Go to your profile and update your status. Also under "Edit profile" in "What I do" row put your biostack
 * note there are 8 biostacks that define your area of specialization: 
    * Genomics
    * Drug development
    * Vaccine informatics
    * Medicinal chemistry
    * Cheminformatics
    * Data analytics
    * Software development
    * Science communication 

+  Individuals should write a script (using any language) that prints your name, your email, your slack ID (with @) , your biostack, Twitter ID and Hamming distance(Between Slack ID and Twitter ID)
  * Note that we have to have at least 7 different languages. IMPORTANT: Inform the version of the program. Follow below to find yours:
    * [x] Python 
    * [x] Java
    * [x] Ruby
    * [x] R
    * [x] Perl
    * [X] PHP
    * [ ] Bash

    * Any other that you know (please inform us on our channel)

+ Create your own repository on Github. You will use it to first upload your script to Github
 *Push the script to our team‚Äôs github repository
  * Fork the team's repo on the top right of your screen on github
  * commit the file and create a pull request to the master
+ Collaboratively as a team, include a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team‚Äôs scripts
+ Submit your team‚Äôs github link to ‚Äãonly‚Äã the bash script

###### Output Template (Your script output should be something like this)
```
NAME: *Your full name*
E-MAIL: *Your e-mail* 
SLACK USERNAME: @+*username*
BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose. The only first letter is capital* 
TWITTER HANDLE:@*username*
HAMMING DISTANCE: *Hamming distance between SLACK USERNAME and TWITTER HANDLE, output would be obtained as a numeric value*
```
***After you get the desired output, please name your file yourname_stage_0_script.py/R/sh etc;
An example: Stage0_Premnath_script.py***
